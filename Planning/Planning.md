# **Business Pinterest- Cozy Corner**

## **Cozy Corner**

Cozy corner is a small, local, family owned flower boutique that specializes in wedding arrangements.

Although we are still small, our customer base is growing and many of our clients ask if we have a website. I would like to create a simple web application to help our business grow.

## **Web Application with Django and Python**

### **Silver Package : Pinterest using floral arrangements**

Many times, brides have a hard time articulating what type of flowers or arrangements they want for bridal bouquets, groomsmen boutineers, and or centerpieces.

Once the base website is made:

- Users can update his/her user page by clicking on the photos in the gallery and adding it to his/her User page
- Client can then send us his/her chosen arrangements with customization notes (if needed) to help us craft the perfect arrangement for your wedding needs
